## Abacus

Problem: 

Model addition on an abacus.

Given two integers of one or more digits, return their sum.

The integers are represented as lists, each containing only one-character strings, such that each one-character string represents a single digit. The sum is similarly a list of one-character strings of single digits.

There is a Pytest test program included in the repository.

The program `abacus.py` is a solution, as is `brute_force_abacus.py`. The program `abacus_original.py` is a shell, to be used in solving the problem.
