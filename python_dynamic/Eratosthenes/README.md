## Sieve of Eratosthenes

Implements a simple sieve of Eratosthenes. To run, in interpreter:

    import eratosthenes as E
    E.sift(number_of_primes)

where `number_of_primes` is the number of primes desired.

The algorithm is somewhat inefficient, in that integers with more than one prime factor are sifted out as many times as they have prime factors.
