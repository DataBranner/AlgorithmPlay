## Sort Mixed List

### Problem

Given a list of multiple data types, sort each group of datatypes independently of the others. The "sorted" list still has a given datatype in the same position where the original list had an instance of that datatype, but all the instances of a particular datatype now appear, among themselves, in sorted order.

For instance, given

    [2, 'a', 1, 'g', 3, 'c']

return

    [1, 'a', 2, 'c', 3, 'g']

The integers 1, 2, 3 are now in sorted order, as are the strings 'a', 'c', 'g'. 

Do this for any number of datatypes found in the input string.

### Other information

This is coded for Python3. There is a rudimentary test suite. The whole project was built in 25 minutes as a speed practice problem.
