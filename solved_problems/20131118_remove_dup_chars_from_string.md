## Remove duplicate characters from string

Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine An extra copy of the array is not. (Gayle Laakmann, _Cracking the Coding Interview_, Ideas, 1.3)

    FOLLOW UP: Write the test cases for this method.

  1. Use the quadratic solution to "20131118_test_unique_chars_in_string.md". Remove each duplicate as found.
