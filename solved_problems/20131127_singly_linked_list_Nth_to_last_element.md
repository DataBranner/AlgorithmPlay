## Nth to last element of singly linked list

Implement an algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list.  (Gayle Laakmann, _Cracking the Coding Interview_, Linked Lists, 2.2)

  * The only way to find the length of the list is to traverse it once. So traverse it once to find the total length, and after that traverse it a second time up to the nth to last element.
