## Permutation

Generate a list of all the permutations of an input list.

There are recursive and dynamic (recursive with memoization) versions.

Run in repl as:

    import permutation as P
    P.permuations_recursive(the_list)
    P.permutations_dynamic(the_list)

for some list `the_list`.

[end]
