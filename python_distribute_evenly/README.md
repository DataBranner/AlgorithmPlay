## Distribute Evenly

**Goal: Make sure each library has the catalog of each other library.**

This is written for Python3. I have described the input and output in the docstring rather than here in the README file. There are also a few tests in a Pytest directory.

Debug-print lines have been left in the code to assist the writing of further tests in future, but they have been commented out.

### To Do

 1. Further tests: use the output to update contents of `libraries` and then see if all the libraries's sets of catalogs are complete.
 1. Fuller README.
